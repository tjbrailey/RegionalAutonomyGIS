# RegionalAutonomyGIS
When ethnic groups are granted some level of regional autonomy by the state, do we expect to see an increase in conflict? If so, is it the recently empowered subnational region that instigates violence, or those marginalized groups sans autonomy? This project utilizes geographic information systems (GIS) in order to map conflict rates in and around newly autonomous regions.
